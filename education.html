            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>My first kindergarten is PASTI when I 5 years old which are in 2009 and I moved
                to TABIKA KEMAS after a year at PASTI . After that, I start my primaly school in 2011 at SK Geting. Not too far from my house. So, sometimes I just go to school with
                bicycle,if my father give a permission for that. As you can see, I'm just ordinary student, and I don't have much memories at primaly school.</p>

        <h2>Secondary SchoolðŸ“š</h2> 
    </header>
            <p>Alhamdulillah, in 2017, I continue my studies at Maahad Muhammadi Tumpat, where is my brothers and sisters also study there.   Everything start here. About my weakness, my abilities, about friends, teachers, people and more!
                I meet a lot of good people and they also teach me without hestitate. That was my secondary school and I called it second home.
                That was because when I was form 6, and when the exam just come nearly, my friends and I stay at school start 7 a.m. until 6 pm. 
                Even at weekend, I still go to school to study. None stop until the day of examination come. Alhamdulillah, I got level JAYYID in STAM (Sijil Tinggi Menengah Agama).
